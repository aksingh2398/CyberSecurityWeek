# Conditional Access and AAD Identity Protection
# Challenge

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept of features that enhance Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Specifically, you want to evaluate:

- Azure AD multi-factor authentication
- Azure AD conditional access
- Azure AD Identity Protection

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class.
